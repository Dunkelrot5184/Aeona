# ⁉ Guess The Word

To have Aeona make a channel for you to use it then run `+autosetup guess-the-word`&#x20;

**Or**&#x20;

If you wish to set it to a particular channel then then run `+setup guess-the-word`

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are setting the channel make sure it is a text channel.
{% endhint %}
